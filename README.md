# UC Standard Format
A saving format that can be used in any Cell Machine remake.

You can find the details in the STANDARD.md file.

# Standardized
UC (UniCell) has a specific standard that any remake that wants to use it can refer to. It is designed to be compact while allowing remakes to share level codes between eachother.

# Universal Cell ID's
Universal cell ID's are defined in the STANDARD.md file. They can allow remakes to translate cells cleanly. For example, if one remake calls a one-directional an "arrow" while another calls it a "directional", they can use the universal cell ID "push1" to avoid confusion.

# Open-Source
You are free to make pull requests/request changes to this format in order to improve it or add a feature that your remake requires.

# Versitility
UC is versitile and can be used for different things, as it supports:
- The use of non-universal ID's
- Grid data (remake of origin, level name, description, etc...)
- Cell variables
- Multiple layers of cells (for backgrounds/foregrounds)
